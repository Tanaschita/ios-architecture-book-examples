# Architecture & Design Patterns for iOS – Code Samples

This repository provides companion code samples for my book *Architecture & Design Patterns for iOS*. Each folder contains a minimal, runnable project that illustrates the concepts and patterns discussed in the corresponding chapter.

The examples focus on areas where readers asked to see the ideas in practice. If there's a particular pattern or topic you'd like to see covered here, feel free to open an issue or reach out.
